Here is what I have done:
1). Wrote a ML model using simple linear regression
2). Created an app.py for the API
3). Created an index.html file for the input.
4). Generated the requirements.txt
5). The endpoint of this application is http://127.0.0.1:5000/ which is nothing but index.html which inturns call the API and the model.
